            "I made your pavlova recipe today and it was delicous!As usual, your recipe was easy to follow. There's four
            of us here and there's only one third left. It'll be gone soon. Thanks for another great recipe!"

            Michelle, just wanted to send you a quick email to tell you that I really love your recipes. I have always
            loved to cook, but I haven't been much of a baker. I have been taking more and more and I find that your
            recipes are always the best.

            EVERYONE has asked you for recipe..
