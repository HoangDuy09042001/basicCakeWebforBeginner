        <h2>Classic Yellow Cake with Chocolate Frosting</h2>
        <p>The fluffy vanilla cake recipe is the absolute best yellow cake from scratch and paired with the silky smooth
            chocolate frosting, you can't beat it for a classic birthday on any other celebration!</p>
        <img class="photo" src="./images/cake1/cake1_1.PNG" alt="Ảnh bánh ngọt">
        <p>Are you a box mix yellow cake person? Or a from-scratch yellow cake person?</p>
        <p>Truth be sold, it's REALLY hard to replicate that always-moist-fluffy texture that everyone loves about a box
            cake mix, but at the same time, we also love homemade, right?</p>
        <p>It took me a LONG time to find a homemade yellow cake that I really, really loved. Box cake mixes seem to
            always bake up perfect fluffy and moist yellow cakes, and the ones I've had from bakeries have been great as
            well, but I just couldn't seem to replicate it at home no matter how many recipes I tried. (Consequently, I
            haven't hat the same issue with chocolate cakes! See: Snickers Cake-the base recipe for all of my chocolate
            cakes)
        </p>
        <p>Many were too dense, too dry, too chiffon-like, too fussy in their preparation. I just wanted a fantastic
            yellow cake recipe I could use for birthday cakes that was easy to make and turned out delicous. I came
            across this recipe from Joy while I was on the hunt for yet another recipe to test out for Joseph's birthday
        </p>
        <p>This was IT. The recipe that had eluded me for years</p>
        <img src="./images/cake1/cake1_2.PNG" alt="" class="photo">
        <p>
            I love that this can easily be mixed together in one bowl using my hand mixer; there's nothing fussy about
            the ingredients or preparation, and it produces an absolutely perfect yellow cake. This layers are light but
            sturdy, buttery and moist, and the ideal base for your very favourite chocolate frosting.
        </p>
        <p>
            I used the chocolate frosting recipe from my ultimate chocolate cupcakes, and it was a wonderful compansion
            to this cake. The frosting is more buttery than surgary, santity smooth and full of rich chocolate flavor.
            It glides on like dream!

            Yellow cake tends to be the elusive unicorn of homemade baking; so many cakes can turn out too dry, too
            crumbly, too dense, too cornbread-like, and I have one major piece of advicr for ensuring perfection:
        </p>
        <p><b>
                Make sure all of the ingredients listed "at room temperature" ARE ACTUALLY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE
            </b></p>
        <p>
            I've totally been there amd have used still-cool butter, eggs or dairy in a recipe when I'm in hurry, but
            it's actually vitally important here. Having all of those ingredients at room temperature ensure that they
            emulsify, which traps air in the batter and, once in the oven, that air expands and produces a fluffy cake.
        </p>
        <p>
            Room temperature ingredients also ensure that the batter comes well and is ultra-smooth, which keeps the
            resulting cake from crumbly or cornbread-like
        </p>
